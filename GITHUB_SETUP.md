# GitHub Repository Setup Guide

Follow these steps to set up your GitHub repository for the Notes Processor application:

## 1. Create a New Repository on GitHub

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and sign in to your account
2. Click on the "+" icon in the top-right corner and select "New repository"
3. Name your repository "NotesProcessor"
4. Add a description: "A full-stack web application that allows users to upload handwritten notes and convert them into structured digital documents"
5. Choose "Public" or "Private" visibility based on your preference
6. Do NOT initialize the repository with a README, .gitignore, or license (we'll push our existing code)
7. Click "Create repository"

## 2. Download the Project Files

Download the `NotesProcessor-clean.tar.gz` file from this environment. This archive contains all the necessary project files without the node_modules directories.

## 3. Extract and Set Up the Repository Locally

```bash
# Extract the archive
tar -xzvf NotesProcessor-clean.tar.gz

# Rename the directory if needed
mv NotesProcessor-clean NotesProcessor

# Navigate to the project directory
cd NotesProcessor

# Initialize a git repository
git init

# Add all files to git
git add .

# Commit the files
git commit -m "Initial commit: Full-stack Notes Processor application"

# Add your GitHub repository as the remote origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/NotesProcessor.git

# Push the code to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

## 4. Set Up GitHub Pages (Optional)

If you want to host the frontend on GitHub Pages:

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click on "Settings"
3. Scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section
4. Select the branch you want to deploy (e.g., "main")
5. Select the "/docs" folder or configure it to use the "gh-pages" branch
6. Click "Save"

Note: You'll need to build the frontend and place the build files in the appropriate location for GitHub Pages to serve them.

## 5. Install Dependencies and Run the Application

After setting up the repository, you'll need to install the dependencies and run the application:

```bash
# Install frontend dependencies
cd frontend
npm install

# Run the frontend development server
npm run dev

# In a separate terminal, install backend dependencies
cd ../backend
npm install

# Run the backend development server
npm run dev
```

## 6. Configure AWS Services

Follow the AWS setup instructions in the README.md file to configure the necessary AWS services for the application.
